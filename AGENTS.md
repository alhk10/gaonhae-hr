# Project architecture

- Resolve invoice PDFs through the saved active template for each invoice's own branch country, never a generic country fallback, so branding and payment details stay accurate after branch changes.
- Public invoice-detail SECURITY DEFINER functions attach only the matched invoice's country template; `/hello` uses its session-validated invoice list to preserve access checks.
